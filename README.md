# Post-installation script that fits most Fedora Desktop users
To run it, paste this in your terminal:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mr-Raian/Fedora-post-installation-script/main/setup.sh | bash
```
Remember to check what the script is doing. Maybe it's filling your disk with random memes, or sending all your data to my grandmas. **Never** run random scripts from the internet without checking what it does!
